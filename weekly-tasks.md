# Tasks

## Week 1
- [x] Read through paper
- [x] Look at GitHub
- [x] Set up a workflowâ€” set up my own GitHub
    - [x] start with county graphs
    - [x] loop through all graphs and see if i can get number of vertices
    - [x] how will I store graphs and data
    - [ ] ~~try to make missing graphs~~
        - [ ] ~~find shape files and turn into graphs and then write to json file~~
    - [ ] ~~start generating some ideas~~
        - [ ] ~~we want to build random graphs that somehow resemble dual graphs~~
    - [x] write a paragraph summary of what my project is

## Week 2/3
- [ ] try to make missing graphs
    - [ ] find shape files and turn into graphs and then write to json file
- [ ] properties of dual graphs
- [ ] start generating some ideas
    - [ ] we want to build random graphs that somehow resemble dual graphs
    - [ ] research ideas: google scholar, textbooks at the library (random graphs)
        - [ ] what are some random graph models? what is being done?
        - [ ] what are ways to characterize graphs?
    - [ ] bring 2-4 ideas for modeling random graphs and 2-4 ways to assess them
- [x] look at the model prof cannon suggested
    - [x] networkx to store vertices and edges
    - [x] set a random seed
- [ ] write up motivation for current thesis

## Week 4
- [ ] Create a thesis block time during the week (10 to 12 hours)
- [ ] Create a new step list after each day/work time

# Random notes
Our graphs:
- not many high degree vertices (maybe max 50)
- planar or close to planar
